# Database

The backend persists conversations, telemetry, and (later) marketing consent in
Postgres. This document covers the client, how to run migrations, the schema,
and the deliberate separation between the conversation and marketing data.

## Client & connection

We use the **Neon serverless driver** (`@neondatabase/serverless`). As of 2026
Vercel Postgres *is* the Neon native integration, and the older
`@vercel/postgres` SDK is deprecated in its favour. We use the driver's HTTP
query function (`neon()`), which is the right fit for short serverless queries —
no pool or WebSocket to manage.

Connection strings come from the env vars the Neon Vercel integration injects
automatically (you don't set these by hand in production):

| Purpose            | Modern var              | Legacy var (also injected)   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Pooled (runtime)   | `DATABASE_URL`          | `POSTGRES_URL`               |
| Direct (migrations)| `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` | `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`   |

`src/lib/db.ts` reads them and exposes `getSql()`. **It returns `null` when no
connection string is set** — every caller treats persistence as optional
infrastructure, so the chat works with or without a database. A DB write must
never break a chat response.

## Running migrations

Migrations are plain `.sql` files in [`migrations/`](../migrations), applied in
filename order by a small forward-only runner (`scripts/migrate.mjs`). Applied
files are recorded in a `_migrations` table, so re-running is a no-op.

```bash
# Uses the connection string from .env (DATABASE_URL[_UNPOOLED] / POSTGRES_URL…)
npm run db:migrate

# Or against an explicit database:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… node scripts/migrate.mjs
```

The runner prefers the **unpooled** connection string for DDL and falls back to
the pooled one. To add a migration, drop a new file like
`migrations/0002_xxx.sql` — it must use plain DDL (`--` comments and `;`
statement separators; no dollar-quoted function bodies, which the lightweight
splitter doesn't parse).

## Schema overview

The schema is split into **two clusters** (see the separation rationale below).

### Cluster A — conversation / analytics (pseudonymous)

| Table           | Key columns                                                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conversations` | `session_id` (unique), `created_at`/`updated_at`/`last_activity_at`, `persona_label`, `message_count`, `recommended_product_ids` (text[]), `selected_product_ids` (text[]), `status` (active/abandoned/converted) |
| `messages`      | `conversation_id` (FK, cascade), `client_message_id` (idempotency), `role`, `content`, `tool_name`  |
| `kpi_events`    | `session_id`, `event`, `data` (jsonb), `created_at`                                                  |
| `ai_usage`      | `conversation_id` (FK, cascade, nullable), `call_site`, `model`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `estimated`, `created_at` (migration 0012) |
| `feedback`      | `message` (the comment), optional context: `session_id`, `conversation_id`, `tier`, `email`, `page`; `created_at` (migration 0020) |

- **Write path:** `/api/chat` calls `persistTurn()` (`src/lib/conversation-store.ts`)
  in its `onFinish` handler — *after* the stream finishes, so it adds no token
  latency. It upserts the conversation by `session_id`, records the persona
  label, accumulates `recommended_product_ids` from product-referencing tool
  calls, and inserts the new user + assistant messages.
- **Selected vs discussed:** `recommended_product_ids` is the DISCUSSED set —
  every product any tool call referenced, accumulated additively (including
  compared-and-rejected alternatives). `selected_product_ids` is the SELECTED
  set — only the products the user expressed intent to buy, i.e. the ids of
  the latest `add_to_cart` (direct-checkout) tool call. It is **replaced** with
  the latest selection each turn (not accumulated), so switching to an
  alternative drops the rejected product. Cart links (summary email, marketing
  email/dashboard) prefer the selected set and fall back to the discussed set
  only when no selection was made — see `chooseCartProductIds` in
  `src/lib/cart.ts`.
- **Idempotency:** message inserts dedupe on
  `(conversation_id, client_message_id, COALESCE(tool_name,''))`, so re-sent
  history never duplicates rows.
- **Telemetry:** `/api/kpi` inserts pseudonymous `kpi_events` (the widget's
  fail-silent `track()`), best-effort.
- **AI cost (migration 0012):** every AI call records one `ai_usage` row — model
  id + provider-reported input/output token counts (`estimated` flags the rare
  case where they're estimated, e.g. an embeddings response with no usage field).
  CHAT usage carries `conversation_id` (so it cascade-deletes with its
  conversation); dashboard/admin/embedding calls leave it NULL. `recordAiUsage()`
  in `src/lib/ai-usage-store.ts` is best-effort (no DB ⇒ no-op, never throws).
  The KPI tab turns token counts into EUR via the model→price table in
  `src/lib/ai-pricing.mjs` — USD per million tokens with sane defaults for the
  models we call, overridable via the `MODEL_PRICES_JSON` env var; EUR conversion
  via `USD_EUR_RATE` (default 0.92). `getAiCostMetrics()` reports average/median
  cost per consultation, total spend, and a chat-vs-dashboard split.
- **Feedback (migration 0020):** `POST /api/feedback` stores one free-text
  customer comment per row (`insertFeedback` in `src/lib/feedback-store.ts`),
  with optional context — `session_id`/`conversation_id` (pseudonymous, plain
  TEXT, **no FK** so a comment survives a retention purge of its conversation),
  `tier`, `page`, and an optional `email`. Light abuse protection: a dedicated
  tight rate-limit bucket plus a 4000-char cap enforced in
  `feedback-validation.mjs` before insert. The admin **Feedback** tab reads it
  read-only, newest-first (`listFeedback`). *On the `email` column:* it appears
  only when the widget already knows an identified address, and is user-supplied
  **contact context for that comment** (the same shape as `/api/contact`'s
  email) — it is **not** a consent record and grants no permission. The
  audit-grade consent trail remains exclusively in `email_captures` (Cluster B),
  so the "email lives in exactly one place" invariant for *consent* is intact.

### Cluster B — consent / marketing (email lives ONLY here)

| Table              | Key columns                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `email_captures`   | `email`, `customer_id` (FK → customers, SET NULL), `transactional_consent`, `marketing_consent`, `marketing_doi_status`, `doi_token`, `doi_confirmed_at`, `consent_text_shown`, `consent_copy_version` (audit stamp, migration 0011), `unsubscribed_at` |
| `suppression_list` | `email` (PK), `added_at`, `reason`                                                                       |
| `marketing_sends`  | `email_capture_id` (FK, cascade), `drafted_text`, `discount_code`, `sent_at`, `status` (draft/approved/sent), `shopify_order_matched` |
| `customers`        | `email` (unique — the person key), `first_seen_at`/`last_seen_at`, `transactional_consent` + `marketing_status` (aggregated mirror of the capture), `profile_summary` + `profile_summary_updated_at` (regenerated "current understanding"), `purchase_summary` (jsonb Shopify order history) + `purchase_summary_updated_at` |

### The customer entity (migration 0008)

A **customer** is keyed by email — the only reliable cross-session identifier
(given with consent). The localStorage session id is a per-browser *thread* id,
not a person; anonymous sessions are never linked across visits.

**Linking rule:** a conversation gets a `customer_id` when (and only when) an
email is captured for that session via `/api/capture-email`
(`linkCustomerOnEmailCapture` in `src/lib/customer-store.ts` find-or-creates
the customer, attaches the conversation, and bumps `last_seen_at`). Sessions
without an email capture stay anonymous and unlinked. Multiple sessions under
one email = the returning-customer case. `email_captures` remains the
audit-grade source of truth for consent; `customers` only mirrors the
aggregated state.

See [`CUSTOMERS.md`](./CUSTOMERS.md) for the full model and the open GDPR
TODO on profile building.

## Why conversations and marketing are separate

This separation is a GDPR design decision, not just tidiness:

1. **Different lawful bases.** Conversations/analytics run on *legitimate
   interest / service provision*; marketing email runs on *explicit consent*.
   Mixing them would let the weaker basis contaminate the stronger one.
2. **Email is quarantined.** An email address appears in **exactly one place**
   (`email_captures`). Conversations are pseudonymous (`session_id` only), so
   the bulk of stored data carries no directly-identifying field.
3. **No implicit join between clusters.** For anonymous traffic the only
   bridge is the pseudonymous `session_id`, which a user can sever by clearing
   browser storage. Since migration 0008 there is **one explicit,
   consent-anchored exception**: `conversations.customer_id`, set only when the
   user actively submits their email for that session. The FK is
   `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so erasing a customer returns their conversations to
   plain pseudonymous rows.
4. **Independent retention.** Each cluster expires on its own schedule (see
   [`DATA_RETENTION.md`](./DATA_RETENTION.md)) — e.g. purging a marketing
   capture on unsubscribe doesn't touch conversation analytics, and deleting an
   old conversation doesn't touch a still-valid marketing consent.

See [`DATA_RETENTION.md`](./DATA_RETENTION.md) for lawful basis and retention
windows in detail.
